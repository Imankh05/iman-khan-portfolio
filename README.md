### 3. Push your portfolio to GitHub

Once you've created this repository and added the `README.md`, you can add additional directories for your code projects:

1. **Project directories** (e.g., `/brainwizz`, `/AI_Writing_Evaluator`) where you can include code for each project.
2. For each project, create subdirectories for the following:
   - **Code:** Your source code files (e.g., `index.html`, `app.py`, `main.py`).
   - **Documentation:** A `README.md` file to explain the project and how to run it.
   - **Assets:** Any relevant images, logos, or screenshots of the project.
